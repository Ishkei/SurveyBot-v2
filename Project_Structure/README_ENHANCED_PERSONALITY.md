# Enhanced Personality System for SurveyBot

## üöÄ Overview

The Enhanced Personality System transforms your SurveyBot from a basic automation tool into an intelligent, human-like AI assistant. This system incorporates advanced prompt engineering techniques from leading AI research, enabling your bot to engage in natural conversations, write in human-like styles, and adapt its personality based on context.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üåü Natural Conversation Framework

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Access to Google Gemini API (optional, for enhanced responses)

### Quick Install
```bash
# Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements_enhanced_personality.txt

# For minimal install (core functionality only)
pip install google-generativeai aiohttp python-dotenv
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Set your Gemini API key (optional)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Or create a .env file
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

## üîß Configuration

### Basic Configuration
The system automatically loads configuration from `enhanced_ai_config.json`. Key settings include:

```json
{
  "enhanced_personality_system": {
    "enabled": true,
    "default_mode": "natural_conversation"
  },
  "ai_integration": {
    "gemini_api": {
      "enabled": true,
      "model": "gemini-1.5-flash-latest"
    }
  }
}
```

### Personality Modes
- `natural_conversation`: Default mode for authentic dialogue
- `human_writer`: Professional human-like writing style
- `ai_team_simulation`: Team-based problem solving
- `discord_casual`: Casual developer conversation style

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from enhanced_personality_system import EnhancedPersonalitySystem

# Initialize the system
system = EnhancedPersonalitySystem()

# Generate responses in different modes
async def get_responses():
    # Natural conversation
    response1 = await system.generate_enhanced_response(
        "How does the survey bot work?",
        mode="natural_conversation"
    )
    
    # Human writer style
    response2 = await system.generate_enhanced_response(
        "Explain the technical architecture",
        mode="human_writer"
    )
    
    # AI team simulation
    response3 = await system.generate_enhanced_response(
        "How do we handle complex surveys?",
        mode="ai_team_simulation"
    )
    
    return response1, response2, response3
```

### Integration with Existing Bot
```python
from enhanced_bot_integration import EnhancedBotIntegration

# Initialize integration
integration = EnhancedBotIntegration()

# Get enhanced responses
async def get_bot_response(question, context=""):
    response = await integration.get_enhanced_response(
        question, 
        context, 
        mode="natural_conversation"
    )
    return response

# Switch personality modes dynamically
integration.switch_personality_mode("human_writer")
```

### Survey-Specific Responses
```python
# Generate responses for different survey question types
async def handle_survey_question(question, question_type, context=""):
    response = await integration.generate_survey_response(
        question,
        question_type,  # "text", "multiple_choice", "rating"
        context
    )
    return response
```

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Dynamic Mode Switching
```python
# Switch between personality modes based on context
if user_is_technical:
    integration.switch_personality_mode("human_writer")
elif user_is_casual:
    integration.switch_personality_mode("discord_casual")
else:
    integration.switch_personality_mode("natural_conversation")
```

### Context Memory
The system maintains conversation history and context for more coherent interactions:

```python
# Get conversation history
history = integration.get_conversation_history()

# Context-aware responses automatically use previous conversation
response = await integration.get_enhanced_response(
    "What did we discuss earlier?",
    context="Referring to previous conversation"
)
```

### Fallback Systems
The system includes multiple fallback layers:
1. **Enhanced AI System**: Uses Gemini API for sophisticated responses
2. **Legacy System**: Falls back to existing personality responses
3. **Basic Fallback**: Provides simple but helpful responses

## üß™ Testing and Demo

### Run the Demo
```bash
python demo_enhanced_personality.py
```

The demo showcases:
- All personality modes in action
- Dynamic mode switching
- Integration features
- System status and capabilities

### Test Individual Components
```python
# Test personality system directly
from enhanced_personality_system import EnhancedPersonalitySystem

system = EnhancedPersonalitySystem()
response = await system.generate_enhanced_response(
    "Test question",
    mode="natural_conversation"
)
print(response)
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Enhanced System Not Available
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced personality system not available. Using enhanced fallback responses.
```
**Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and the module is accessible.

#### Gemini API Errors
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to initialize Gemini: [Error details]
```
**Solution**: Check your API key and internet connection. The system will fall back to enhanced fallback responses.

#### Import Errors
```
ImportError: No module named 'enhanced_personality_system'
```
**Solution**: Ensure you're running from the correct directory or add the project to your Python path.

### Performance Optimization

#### Memory Management
- The system automatically manages conversation history
- Adjust `max_history` in configuration for memory usage
- Use `clear_conversation_history()` if needed

#### Response Caching
- Consider implementing response caching for repeated questions
- Use async/await properly for optimal performance

## üöÄ Integration with Existing SurveyBot

### Seamless Enhancement
The enhanced system is designed to work alongside your existing SurveyBot without breaking changes:

1. **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality remains intact
2. **Gradual Migration**: Enable features one by one
3. **Fallback Support**: Always provides responses even if enhancement fails

### Migration Path
```python
# Before (existing code)
response = get_personality_response(question)

# After (enhanced)
response = await get_enhanced_bot_response(question, mode="natural_conversation")

# Or keep existing and enhance gradually
enhancer = SurveyBotEnhancer(existing_bot)
enhanced_func = enhancer.enhance_response_generation(original_function)
```

## üìö Advanced Configuration

### Custom Personality Modes
You can create custom personality modes by extending the system:

```python
# Add custom mode to configuration
custom_mode = {
    "name": "Professional Consultant",
    "description": "Formal business consultant style",
    "voice_style": [
        "Use formal business language",
        "Provide structured analysis",
        "Include actionable recommendations"
    ]
}

# The system will automatically recognize and use custom modes
```

### API Integration
The system supports multiple AI providers:

```json
{
  "ai_integration": {
    "gemini_api": {"enabled": true},
    "openai_api": {"enabled": false},
    "local_models": {"enabled": false}
  }
}
```
