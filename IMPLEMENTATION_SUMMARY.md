- Concise but informative responses
- Discord server style communication

## ðŸ”§ How to Use the Enhanced System

### Basic Usage

```python
from enhanced_bot_integration import get_enhanced_bot_response

# Async usage
response = await get_enhanced_bot_response(
    "How does the bot work?",
    mode="natural_conversation"
)

# Sync usage
from enhanced_bot_integration import get_enhanced_bot_response_sync
response = get_enhanced_bot_response_sync(
    "How does the bot work?",
    mode="discord_casual"
)
```

### Advanced Integration

```python
from enhanced_bot_integration import EnhancedBotIntegration

# Initialize the integration system
integration = EnhancedBotIntegration()

# Switch personality modes
integration.switch_personality_mode("human_writer")

# Generate survey-specific responses
survey_response = await integration.generate_survey_response(
    "What is your experience level?",
    "multiple_choice",
    "Survey about user experience"
)

# Get system status
status = integration.get_system_status()
```

### Dynamic Mode Switching

```python
# Available modes
modes = integration.get_available_modes()
# ['natural_conversation', 'human_writer', 'ai_team_simulation', 'discord_casual']

# Switch to different mode
integration.switch_personality_mode("ai_team_simulation")

# Get current mode
current_mode = integration.get_current_mode()
```

- **Human Writer**: Professional writing indistinguishable from humans
- **AI Team**: Structured problem-solving with multiple perspectives
- **Discord Casual**: Authentic developer communication style

### Fallback Reliability
- **Primary AI**: Google Gemini API
- **Fallback 1**: Enhanced local response generation
- **Fallback 2**: Legacy personality system
- **Fallback 3**: Basic response templates

## ðŸŽ® Testing and Demo

### Run the Full Demo
```bash
python demo_enhanced_personality.py
```

### Test Integration
```bash
python test_integration.py
```

### Test Individual Components
```python
from enhanced_personality_system import EnhancedPersonalitySystem

system = EnhancedPersonalitySystem()
response = await system.generate_enhanced_response(
    "Test question",
    mode="human_writer"
)
```

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

All settings are managed through `enhanced_ai_config.json`:

- **Personality System**: Enable/disable, default modes
- **AI Integration**: API keys, model selection, fallback settings
- **Conversation**: Memory settings, adaptation parameters
- **Survey Bot**: Specific enhancements and features
- **Quality**: Validation and improvement settings

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. **Set Up API Keys** (Optional)
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### 2. **Customize Personalities**
Edit `enhanced_ai_config.json` to adjust personality settings

### 3. **Integrate with Main Bot**
Use the integration functions in your main bot code

### 4. **Test and Refine**
Run demos and adjust settings based on your needs
