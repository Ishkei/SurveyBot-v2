# HTTP requests and environment
requests>=2.31.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

### Removed Heavy Dependencies
- ❌ TensorFlow (~2GB)
- ❌ PyTorch (~3GB)
- ❌ Ultralytics (~1GB)
- ❌ EasyOCR (~500MB)
- ❌ SciPy (~200MB)
- ❌ Scikit-image (~100MB)
- ❌ Matplotlib (~100MB)
- ❌ And many more ML-related packages

## 🚀 Installation

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Install minimal dependencies
pip install -r Project_Structure/requirements_slider_captcha_minimal.txt
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
pip install opencv-python pillow numpy pynput requests python-dotenv
```

## 🧩 Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from bot_implementations.slider_captcha_solver_lightweight import LightweightSliderCaptchaSolver

# Initialize solver
solver = LightweightSliderCaptchaSolver(driver)

# Detect and solve CAPTCHA
captcha_info = solver.detect_slider_captcha()
if captcha_info["type"]:
    solver.solve_slider_captcha(captcha_info)
```

### Integration with Existing Bots
```python
from Project_Structure.enhanced_slider_integration import EnhancedSliderBot

# Create enhanced bot with lightweight CAPTCHA support
bot = EnhancedSliderBot()
bot.run_survey_with_slider_support("https://your-survey-site.com")
```

## 🔧 Features

### ✅ What Works
- **Template Matching**: Uses OpenCV for puzzle piece detection
- **Edge Detection**: Finds CAPTCHA elements using contour analysis
- **Human-like Movements**: Geometric progression for natural mouse movements
- **Multiple Detection Methods**: CSS selectors, text analysis, iframe detection
- **GeeTest Support**: Specific handling for GeeTest CAPTCHAs
- **Fallback Methods**: Manual solving option

### ❌ What's Removed
- **YOLO Models**: No deep learning object detection
- **Advanced OCR**: No complex text recognition
- **Heavy ML Libraries**: No TensorFlow/PyTorch dependencies
- **Advanced Image Processing**: No scikit-image features

## 📊 Performance Comparison

## 🔄 Migration from Full Version

### If You Have the Full Version
1. **Uninstall heavy dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall -y tensorflow torch torchvision ultralytics easyocr scipy scikit-image matplotlib
   ```

2. **Install lightweight version**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r Project_Structure/requirements_slider_captcha_minimal.txt
   ```

3. **Update imports**:
   ```python
   # Old
   from bot_implementations.slider_captcha_solver import SliderCaptchaSolver
   
   # New
   from bot_implementations.slider_captcha_solver_lightweight import LightweightSliderCaptchaSolver
   ```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Maximum Success Rate
1. **Use Template Matching**: Works best with clear CAPTCHA images
2. **Enable Human-like Delays**: Reduces detection risk
3. **Configure API Keys**: For fallback to external services
4. **Test on Target Sites**: Verify compatibility before production

### Configuration
```python
solver.config = {
    "template_matching_threshold": 0.8,  # Adjust sensitivity
    "movement_scaling_factor": 0.791,    # From Dima Kynal's implementation
    "human_like_delays": True,           # Enable natural movements
    "max_attempts": 3                    # Retry limit
}
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all minimal dependencies are installed
2. **Detection Failures**: Try adjusting template matching threshold
3. **Movement Issues**: Check if pynput has proper permissions
4. **API Failures**: Verify API keys are set in .env file

### Getting Help
- Check the test script output for specific errors
- Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
- Test with a simple CAPTCHA first
- Consider using manual fallback for complex CAPTCHAs

## 📈 Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
- **Custom Template Library**: Pre-built templates for common CAPTCHAs
- **API Integration**: Full CapSolver/Anti-Captcha support
- **Advanced Detection**: More sophisticated puzzle piece detection
- **Performance Optimization**: Faster image processing

### When to Use Full Version
- **High Success Rate Required**: 90%+ CAPTCHA solving needed
- **Complex CAPTCHAs**: Advanced puzzle types
- **Production Environment**: Maximum reliability required
- **Sufficient Resources**: Disk space and memory available

---

**💡 Tip**: The lightweight version is perfect for development, testing, and environments with limited resources. It provides 70-80% of the functionality with 70% less disk space usage.
