## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Advanced AI Integration Class**
```python
class AdvancedAIIntegration:
    """Advanced AI integration using Playwright MCP for survey automation."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.discovered_patterns: List[SurveyPattern] = []
        self.generated_tests: List[AITestCase] = []
        self.learning_data: Dict[str, Any] = {}
        self.mcp_server_process = None
```

### **Data Structures**
```python
@dataclass
class SurveyPattern:
    pattern_id: str
    survey_type: str
    question_patterns: List[str]
    navigation_flow: List[str]
    response_templates: Dict[str, str]
    success_rate: float
    detection_method: str

@dataclass
class AITestCase:
    test_id: str
    survey_url: str
    test_scenario: str
    expected_actions: List[str]
    validation_criteria: List[str]
    generated_by: str
```

### **AI Exploration Pipeline**
```python
async def ai_powered_survey_exploration(self):
    """AI-powered exploration to discover new survey patterns."""
    
    exploration_prompts = [
        "Explore the Qmee website and identify all survey-related elements",
        "Map the navigation flow from login to survey completion",
        "Discover common question patterns and response types",
        "Identify survey branching logic and conditional flows",
        "Find anti-bot measures and detection patterns"
    ]
    
    for prompt in exploration_prompts:
        pattern = await self._explore_with_ai(page, prompt)
        if pattern:
            self.discovered_patterns.append(pattern)

```python
PERSONALITY_RESPONSES = {
    "technical_questions": "tbh i work in tech so i'm pretty comfortable with most products",
    "privacy_questions": "honestly it's a big concern, i'm careful about what i share online",
    "opinion_questions": "imo that depends on the context, but generally i think...",

async def generate_context_aware_response(self, question: str, context: Dict) -> str:
    """Generate Discord-style responses based on context."""
    
    question_type = self._classify_question(question)
    template = PERSONALITY_RESPONSES.get(question_type, "honestly i'm not sure")
    
    if context.get("survey_type") == "demographics":
        template = f"for demographics, {template}"
    elif context.get("survey_type") == "opinion":
        template = f"imo {template}"
    
    return template
